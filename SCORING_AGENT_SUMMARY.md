# Scoring Agent Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

I've successfully transformed the Pick1 system from a polling-based architecture to a fully event-driven system with an intelligent Scoring Agent.

### Key Components

1. **Vision Agent** (`vision_agent.py`)
   - Detects objects crossing 50mm line
   - Publishes detailed detection events

2. **Scoring Agent** (in `test_data.py`)
   - Subscribes to vision detection events
   - Tracks only green (pickable) objects
   - Uses 100% FIFO scoring (configurable)
   - Assigns work when CNC announces ready
   - Clears memory after each assignment

3. **Event-Driven CNC** (in `test_data.py`)
   - No polling - waits for assignments
   - Publishes "ready_for_assignment" when idle
   - Executes assigned pickups
   - Immediately ready for next task

## Event Flow

```
Vision detects → Scoring tracks → CNC ready → Scoring assigns → CNC executes → Repeat
```

## Key Design Decisions (Per Your Requirements)

1. **Only track green objects** - Efficient memory usage
2. **100% FIFO scoring** - First detected, first picked
3. **Immediate assignment** - No waiting when CNC ready
4. **Fresh start after assignment** - Clear all tracked objects
5. **Event-driven** - No polling, fully reactive

## Running the System

```bash
# All components with one command:
./run_with_vision.sh

# Monitor events in separate terminal:
python test_event_system.py
```

## Files Modified/Created

- **Modified `test_data.py`** - Added ScoringAgent class and event-driven architecture
- **Created `EVENT_DRIVEN_ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Detailed documentation
- **Created `test_event_system.py`** - Event monitoring tool
- **Updated `run_with_vision.sh`** - Reflects new architecture

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Realistic simulation** - Mimics real industrial automation
2. **Clean separation** - Vision detects, Scoring prioritizes, CNC executes
3. **No missed objects** - CNC only picks vision-detected objects
4. **Fair processing** - FIFO ensures proper order
5. **Scalable** - Easy to add more agents or modify scoring

The system now properly implements your vision where the CNC requests work and the scoring agent responds with optimal assignments based on vision-detected objects.
