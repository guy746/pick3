# CNC & Trigger Camera Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

I've successfully split the CNC functionality into separate modular agents, creating a more realistic industrial automation simulation.

### New Components Created

1. **`gcode_routines.py`**
   - Simple G-code sequences for pickup operations
   - Configurable routines: prepare, pickup, deliver, home
   - Lane-specific positioning

2. **`trigger_camera_agent.py`**
   - Monitors 250mm trigger line for specific objects
   - Lane-specific watching (efficient)
   - Automatic timeout for stale watches
   - Publishes velocity and position data

3. **`cnc_agent.py`**
   - Event-driven CNC controller
   - Pre-positions to assigned lane
   - Coordinates with trigger camera
   - Dynamic timing calculation
   - Executes G-code routines

### Modified Files

1. **`test_data.py`**
   - Removed CNC controller function
   - Removed trigger line detection
   - Removed pickup-related globals
   - Kept scoring agent and object animation

2. **`run_with_vision.sh`**
   - Added trigger camera and CNC agents to startup
   - Updated cleanup to kill all processes

## System Architecture

```
Vision Agent (50mm) → Scoring Agent → CNC Agent → Trigger Camera (250mm) → Pickup
```

## Key Design Decisions (Per Your Requirements)

1. **CNC pre-positions** when assigned (not waiting at trigger)
2. **Dynamic timing** calculation based on actual position/velocity
3. **Simple G-code** routines (down, grab, up)
4. **Lane-specific monitoring** by trigger camera
5. **Assumes success** for all pickups
6. **Minimal events** - only publish at key moments

## Event Communication

- **Scoring → CNC**: `pickup_assignment` with object details
- **CNC → Trigger**: `watch_for_object` with lane and timeout
- **Trigger → CNC**: `object_approaching` with position/velocity
- **CNC → System**: `ready_for_assignment` when complete

## Running the Complete System

```bash
# All agents with one command:
./run_with_vision.sh

# System starts in order:
1. Vision Agent - Detects at 50mm
2. Trigger Camera - Monitors 250mm
3. CNC Agent - Executes pickups
4. Test Data - Scoring and animation
5. Flask App - Visualization
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Realistic timing** - CNC has 0.375s to prepare after trigger
2. **Modular agents** - Each component has single responsibility  
3. **Industrial accuracy** - Mimics real pick-and-place systems
4. **Clean separation** - Vision → Scoring → CNC → Trigger
5. **Scalable design** - Easy to add more CNCs or cameras

The system now properly simulates an industrial automation workflow where:
- Vision identifies objects
- Scoring prioritizes work
- CNC receives assignments and pre-positions
- Trigger camera provides precise timing
- CNC executes G-code routines for pickup
